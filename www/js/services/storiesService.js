            html:'In a small village lived a little boy/girl <b ng-bind="main"></b> and his friend  <b ng-bind="sub"></b>.  <b ng-bind="main"></b> was an apprentice learning how to make weapons in a blacksmith shop.  He worked long hours to make his swords and arrows just right and his/her friend often liked to watch and help. <br><br> One night while <b ng-bind="main"></b> was up working well past the time his friend had gone to bed, there was a loud disturbance outside.  <b ng-bind="main"></b> looked out the door and up the street to see a large band of <b ng-bind="vgroup"></b>s coming down the street.  <b ng-bind="main"></b> grabbed some of his/her finest weapons and charged into battle.  It wasn&#39;t long til <b ng-bind="sub"></b> was fighting right by his side.  "I thought you were in bed!?" <b ng-bind="main"></b> said.  <br/><br/>"How could I sleep with all this noise? And besides, I wasn&#39;t about to let you have all the fun!" <b ng-bind="sub"></b> said while wielding a sword at an oncoming <b ng-bind="vgroup"></b>.<br/><br/>There was a loud "boom" and right in the middle of the street appeared an old man with a long beard.  The <b ng-bind="vgroup"></b>s seemed to recognize him and immediately started running from the street.  "Take a hostage!," one of the <b ng-bind="vgroup"></b>&#39;s yelled as they all headed for the hills.<br/><br/>"<b ng-bind="sub"></b>" gasped <b ng-bind="main"></b> "where&#39;s my friend?" he shouted, "<b ng-bind="main"></b>!"  He heard <b ng-bind="sub"></b> screaming out his/her name as he saw his friend being carried off by the the <b ng-bind="vgroup"></b> in their <b ng-bind="vvehicle"></b>s.  <br/><br/><b ng-bind="main"></b> ran after the <b ng-bind="vgroup"></b>s but they were too fast.  He would never catch them on foot.  <br/><br/>The old man who had appeared out of thin air in the middle of the battle said, "If you want to get your friend back, we&#39;ll need to gather some supplies.  I have a powerful weapon we can use against them to get him/her back."<br/><br/>"Who are you?" <b ng-bind="main"></b> asked.  <br/><br/>"You can call me Bolt" the man replied.  I have power over light and electricity. <br/><br/>Those bully <b ng-bind="vgroup"></b>s hate the light and we can use it get your friend back."<br/><br/>"Then you know where they have taken him/her?" <b ng-bind="main"></b> asked hopefully.<br/><br/>"Yes, to the caves of darkness."  Bolt replied. "But if you are going to come with me, you will need to be prepared for intense brightness.  You will need sunglasses, sunscreen, and a hat.  And Hurry! We need to leave right away!"<br/><br/><b ng-bind="main"></b> quickly ran to his workshop and shoved a bottle of sunscreen into his backpack along with his sunglasses and his cap.  When he ran back out to the street.  Bolt was waiting for him in his awesome <b ng-bind="vehicle"></b>.  "Hop in!" Bolt said.  <br/><br/><b ng-bind="main"></b> jumped right in and got to work applying sunscreen to all of his skin while they drove to the caves of darkness.<br/><br/>Once they got arrived.  They walked right up to the entrance of the cave and Bolt pulled a beautiful sword from it&#39;s sheath at his hip.  He swung it through the air a few times and it began to glow.  "Hand over <b ng-bind="sub"></b>!" He yelled to the <b ng-bind="vgroup"></b>s.  They did nothing so Bolt turned and nodded at <b ng-bind="main"></b>, which was a the signal to put on his sunglasses and hat.  <b ng-bind="main"></b> quickly put them on and Bolt plunged the sword into the ground of cave.  Light burst out through the crack in the ground where the sword had hit.  Light so intense and bright that the <b ng-bind="vgroup"></b>s all screamed and covered their eyes.  Their skin started to sizzle and burn.  As they crumpled helpless to the ground under the intense light.  <b ng-bind="main"></b> ran through the cave and found his friend.  She/he couldn&#39;t see because she/he didn&#39;t have sunglasses so <b ng-bind="main"></b> picked her up and gave her/him his/her hat for some protection from the bright light as he/she ran out of the cave.  <br/><br/>Once they were safely out, Bolt removed his sword from the ground and followed them out to the <b ng-bind="vehicle"></b>.  <b ng-bind="sub"></b> was luckily wearing long sleeves and pants and with the addition of <b ng-bind="main"></b>&#39;s hat, she/he had not been burned by the bright light. <br/><br/>"What was that?" <b ng-bind="sub"></b> asked. <br/><br/>"Intensified sunlight." Bolt responded as he drove them back to their village.  I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have anymore problems from those <b ng-bind="vgroup"></b>&#39;s now.  <br/><br/>They thanked Bolt for his help and told him he was welcome to come visit them anytime.  He said it was his pleasure to help and disappeared in a flash of light.<br/><br/><b ng-bind="main"></b> and <b ng-bind="sub"></b> were happy to be home again and after seeing how much damage that intense sunlight could do.  They always applied sunscreen and wore sunglasses and hats whenever they were in the sun.   The End.'

              html: 'Far away in a desert wasteland, there is a mysterious village called The Rocklands.  Those who have been there will only say that you have to see it to believe it.  They refrain from talking about it because they don&?39;t want anyone to think they are crazy.  They say that what can be witnessed there is just too unbelievable. <br><br> <b ng-bind="main"></b> thought, "What could be so unbelievable that people refuse to talk about it?"  He/she was very curious to go explore The Rocklands for him/herself.  The thought of going to an unknown place also made him/her a little edgy.   Whenever <b ng-bind="main"></b> was edgy, he/she knew that whatever he/she was planning to do needs preparation.  <b ng-bind="main"></b> thought about how to prepare for his/her adventure and decided to build a vehicle so protected and fast that he/she would be able to get out fast if and when the need arises. <br><br> <b ng-bind="main"></b> decided to go to work immediately to build a <b ng-bind="vehicle"></b>.  The <b ng-bind="vehicle"></b> took <b ng-bind="main"></b> many long hours to construct, but when he/she was done, it was <b ng-bind="vgroup"></b>.  <b ng-bind="main"></b> wanted to be sure that his/her <b ng-bind="vehicle"></b> would be able to withstand anything that might be encountered in The Rocklands so he decided to go ask <b ng-bind="vvehicle"></b> if they thought his/her preparation was adequate. <br><br> When <b ng-bind="vvehicle"></b> saw <b ng-bind="main"></b> coming down the street in his/her <b ng-bind="vehicle"></b>, they were alarmed and said, "You are not thinking of going to The Rocklands in that are you?!" <br><br> <b ng-bind="main"></b> just smiled and said, "I&#39;m just so curious! I have to know what it is like there.  I have prepared this vehicle and came to ask if you thought it will be able to protect me on my adventure." <br><br>  <b ng-bind="vvehicle"></b> didn’t like thinking about <b ng-bind="main"></b> going to an unknown place, but when they saw that his/her vehicle was well equipped for the journey they softened to the idea.  <b ng-bind="vvehicle"></b> suggested they go ask their ancient neighbor, Wire Whiskered Harry, who had been to The Rocklands if the <b ng-bind="vehicle"></b> could get them in and out safely.  <b ng-bind="main"></b> could see the wisdom in asking someone who had been there before and so they went to talk to Old Wire Whiskers.  <br><br>  Old Wire Whiskers was wrinkled with long gray hair and walked with slow footsteps.  He put on his thick rectangular glasses and inspected every inch of the <b ng-bind="vehicle"></b>.  Finally, he nodded and said, "I wish that I had one of these when I went to The Rocklands!  If I had, I probably would have made it out without this..." He lifted his pant leg and showed them a gnarly scar on his foot.  "With a vehicle like this, you should be fine.  But, you should tie a baseball glove on the back, just trust me on this one." <br><br>  With Old Wire Whisker’s approval and a baseball glove added for good measure, <b ng-bind="vvehicle"></b> asked if <b ng-bind="main"></b> would help them make more <b ng-bind="vehicle"></b>s so they could join him/her and go too!  <b ng-bind="main"></b> agreed to help his/her friends and was now confident that he could journey to The Rocklands safely.  After <b ng-bind="vvehicle"></b> had their <b ng-bind="vehicle"></b>s made, the whole fleet was ready and took off toward The Rocklands together with <b ng-bind="main"></b> leading the way. <br><br>  When they got there, <b ng-bind="main"></b> saw orange red sand as far as the eye could see.  The sand looked like rolling waves across the desert.   All across the sand there were little piles of round red rocks and in the distance he/she could make out the remain of on old baseball stadium.  The rocks were stacked on top of each other five or six rocks high and there got to be more and more as they approached the ruins of the the stadium.  As <b ng-bind="main"></b> slowed and came in for a closer look, he/she thought he/she saw something move out of the corner of his/her eye.  When he/she turned his/her head to look again there was an army of little stone men chasing them.  "Are you guys seeing this!!?" <b ng-bind="vehicle"></b> yelled to <b ng-bind="vvehicle"></b>. <br><br>  "Lets get out of here!" <b ng-bind="vvehicle"></b> called back.  They all notched up to full speed when <b ng-bind="main"></b> noticed the rocks were no longer chasing them.  They were arranging themselves in a strange pattern on the ground.  "What are they doing?" he/she thought.  "Hey guys," <b ng-bind="main"></b> called to his friends, "I&#39;m headed back for a second look."  <br><br>  "Are you crazy?  Those rocks are alive!" they replied.  <br><br>  <b ng-bind="main"></b> could see they were arranging themselves into letters and he/she was curious about what they were trying to tell him/her.  As he/she approached the rocks were perfectly still, he/she could make words formed by the red rocks in the dusty sand: We are friends, STAY and PLAY followed by what looked like an image of a baseball and bat.  <b ng-bind="main"></b> put his/her finger in the warm gritty sand and used it to spell out: OK.  The rocks jumped up and took the outfield. <br><br>  "They are friendly!" <b ng-bind="main"></b> called to his/her friends.  "They want us to play a little game of baseball with them.  Whose up for it?  I&#39;m staying." <br><br> "Baseball sounds like fun. We&#39;re in too!" said <b ng-bind="vvehicle"></b> coming to join <b ng-bind="main"></b> at the ruins of the stadium.  They played a few innings and had a fantastic time before saying goodbye to their new rock friends and headed for home. <br><br> "You know no one will believe us if we tell anyone back home what happened," <b ng-bind="main"></b> commented to his/her friends. <br><br> "Let&#39;s let anyone curious borrow our <b ng-bind="vehicle"></b>s and they can come find out for themselves," <b ng-bind="vvehicle"></b> replied with a smirk.  "You never know what extraordinary things you might find if you are curious enough to go looking."   The End.'
